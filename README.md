## About The Course
A compiler is a software system that translates a program written in one language (source language) into a semantically equivalent program written in another language (target language).
The goal of this course is to learn principles of compiler construction and related programming language theories.

## Academic Integrity
By registering for this course, I will assume you agree with the policy below.
* All assignments (i.e., writing code) must be your own work. No discussions are allowed.
  * You should not share/show your code.
  * You should not post your code on public websites.
  * You should not modify other students’ code.
* I will have a one-on-one meeting with each student under suspicion. If you fail to prove your integrity in the meeting (e.g., failing to answer my questions about the details of your submissions), I will consider that you cheated on your assignments, even if you do not admit to your cheating.
* Cheating on assignments will result in an F.
